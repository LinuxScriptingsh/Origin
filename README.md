# Origin

Hey folks, LinuxScripting here

I will present you the Origin Installer (right now it's a terminal Script)

Do what you want, download it, change it whatsoever.

It will install EA's origin completly on your Linux System (Linux Mint 17.x, 18.x and Ubuntu 18.04)

Note 1: If you're installing it the first time, be sure to remove the ticks from "Send data to microsoft" and in the "configure wine" window, set your Windows Version to "Windows 10"

Note 2: When you start Origin up, a wine error will appear. Just ignore it, it will work.
