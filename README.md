# Origin on Arch, Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, openSUSE and Fedora 
**[only the latest two versions e.g. Debian 9 & 8]**

Download clone the repository using ``` git clone https://github.com/LinuxSquare/Origin.git ```


Installation:

Step 1: Fire up a terminal inside (or navigate to) the folder, where the script is located.

Step 2: Install Origin by typing ``` ./OriginSetup -i ``` inside the terminal.

Step 3: In winecfg, set your Windowsversion to ```Windows 7```. Apply those changes and close the window.

Step 4: If the Origin Installer is starting, disable everything besides ```create a desktopshurtcut```.

Step 5: If the login window appears, don't login. Instead, close the login window and wait until the terminal has finished it's process.

Update:

Origin doesn't like to update within wine, so for updating origin use this script again.

Important notice! The update-script was written by DrDoctor13. BOTH scripts come WITHOUT warranty.

Step 1: Fire up a terminal inside (or navigate to) the folder, where the script is located.

Step 2: Update Origin by typing ``` ./origin.sh -u ``` inside the terminal.

The script will automatically download the script of DrDoctor13 and will execute automatically with the used WINEPREFIX.

Yours Sincerely
