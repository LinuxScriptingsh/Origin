# Origin on Arch Linux

Download the zip file or clone the repository using ``` git clone https://github.com/LinuxSquare/Origin.git ```


Installation:

Step 1: Fire up a terminal inside (or navigate to) the folder, where the script is located.

Step 2: Install Origin by typing ``` ./origin.sh -i ``` inside the terminal.

Step 3: In winecfg, set your Windowsversion to ```Windows 7```. Apply those changes and close the window.

Step 4: If the Origin is starting, disable everything besides ```create a desktopshurtcut```.

Step 5: After the installation has finished, close everything. Including the Terminal aswell.

Update:

Origin doesn't like to update within wine, so for updating origin use this script again.

Important notice! The update-script was written by DrDoctor13. BOTH scripts come WITHOUT warranty.

Step 1: Fire up a terminal inside (or navigate to) the folder, where the script is located.

Step 2: Update Origin by typing ``` ./origin.sh -u ``` inside the terminal.

The script will automatically download the script of DrDoctor13 and will execute automatically with the used WINEPREFIX.
