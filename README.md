# Origin
Origininstaller

Hey folks, LinuxScripting here

I will present you the Origin Installier (right now it's a terminal Script)

Do what you want, download it, change it whatsoever.

It will install EA's origin completly on your Linux System (Linux Mint 17.x, 18.x and Ubuntu 16.04 [18.04 not available yet])
